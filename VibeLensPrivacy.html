      when you use the VibeLens mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      VibeLens is designed with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong>

    <p>
      Images or content you choose to analyze within the app are processed solely
      to provide app functionality. Unless explicitly stated, this content is not
      stored permanently on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and improve app functionality</li>
      <li>To analyze content only when required for requested features</li>
      <li>To maintain app stability and performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Any temporary data processed by VibeLens is handled securely and retained
      only for the minimum time necessary to deliver the requested service.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      VibeLens may integrate third-party services (such as analytics or sharing
      platforms) to enable certain features. These services may collect
      information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

      VibeLens does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the

      We take reasonable measures to protect information processed through the
      app. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>
